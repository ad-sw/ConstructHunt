A near pixel-perfect <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> clone inspired by the similarities between software developers (virtual/digital builders) and architects/landscape architects/city planners/real estate developers (physical builders).<p>
<br>Public participatory design and voting takes place during town/city meetings for sites; many local stakeholders are unaware of these meetings or can't attend them physically due to timing schedule conflicts. This results in public to private spaces not gaining local population input or accurate datasets.</br>
<br>Additionally, many firms don't have the resources to participate in site competitions; meaning those that do tend to overshadow smaller firms (oligopoly market structure).</br>
<br>The online tool enables greater input, participation and transparency through virtual meetings and interaction.</br>

## Local Use Set Up
This is an example of how to install this on your local computer, versus referencing it off of heroku.com only.

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ad-sw/ConstructHunt.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages / dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment

4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file
Create a .env file based on the example with proper settings for your development environment. Then run database models, migrations, and seeding commands (i.e. `npx sequelize model:generate`, `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`, and `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`).

5. In your source-code editor of choice such as Visual Studio Code, open two terminal windows. Cd one of them into the frontend folder while cd-ing the other into the backend folder. Once inside both of these folders on separate terminal windows, run the `npm start` command to have your browser open `http://localhost:3000/` with the fully-functional project displayed here.
