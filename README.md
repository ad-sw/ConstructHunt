A near pixel-perfect <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> clone inspired by the similarities between software developers (virtual/digital builders) to architects/landscape architects/city planners/real estate developers (physical builders). Public participatory design and voting takes place during town/city meetings for sites up for reconstruction or initial development, similar to how Product Hunt functions for digital products. However, many of these physical sites' local populations are unaware of these meetings or can't attend them physically due to timing schedule conflicts. This results in a lot of physical spaces not gaining the benefit of wider public participatory design or local population input. Additionally, many firms don't have the resources to participate in most competitions for architecture to landscape architecture site designs since there isn't guaranteed business generated for time spent, meaning those that do enter a site's competition tend to be larger dominating ones or potentially well-connected ones to the specific site's competition organizers. This means our towns to cities are developed and grow with bias and inflexibleness/less adaptability from the get-go.

<br>Ideally, there would be an online tool enabling these physical meetings to also be virtual so that the local population's input (from voting to design ideas) represents a wider audience and results in more accurate datasets gathered. This could also enable more firms (architecture, landscape architecture, urban city planning, construction, etc) to enter competitions at a lower resource cost and increase the amount of firms entering, in turn making site development options more diverse, accurate, and better representing of local populations.

## Local Use Set Up
This is an example of how to install this on your local computer, versus referencing it off of heroku.com only.

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ad-sw/ConstructHunt.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages / dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment

4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file
Create a .env file based on the example with proper settings for your development environment. Then run database models, migrations, and seeding commands (i.e. `npx sequelize model:generate`, `npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate`, and `npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all`).

5. In your source-code editor of choice such as Visual Studio Code, open two terminal windows. Cd one of them into the frontend folder while cd-ing the other into the backend folder. Once inside both of these folders on separate terminal windows, run the `npm start` command to have your browser open `http://localhost:3000/` with the fully-functional project displayed here.
